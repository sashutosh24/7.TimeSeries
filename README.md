## Project Overview

The Seasonality Analysis project enables users to identify and visualize seasonal patterns in time-series data. The script is designed to:
1. Decompose time-series data into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
2. Visualize seasonal patterns.
3. Support decision-making for business operations, marketing strategies, and resource planning.
